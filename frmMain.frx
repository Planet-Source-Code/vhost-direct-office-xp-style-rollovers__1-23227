ÿOffice XP Style Rollovers
-------------------------

Heres a quick example of how to make Office XP style rollovers. This is where when the mouse rolls over then button the background changes pale green and the edge changes green.

Needs a bit more work done. Slaped it up in about 8 minutes. Keep on looking i will submit the latest version soon with full property minipulation. So buttons can be added and the bar draged and maybe even full toolbar access like in Office XP. All my own. NO ocx's. (Open Source)
